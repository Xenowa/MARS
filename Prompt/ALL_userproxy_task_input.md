### Boolean  Expressions

Here is a topic for Boolean Expressions:
Evaluate the truth value of a random Boolean expression consisting of Boolean constants (True, False) and basic Boolean operators (and, or, not).

For example:
not ( True ) and ( True ) is

### Disambiguation QA

Here is a topic for disambiguation question:
Given a sentence with an ambigious pronoun, either determine whether the sentence is inherently ambiguous (i.e., the thing that the pronoun refers to cannot be inferred by given information) or, if the pronoun can be implicitly deduced, state the antecedent of the pronoun (i.e., the noun to which the pronoun refers).

For example:

In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.

Sentence: My parent called their secretary for more information

Options:

(A) They were my parent's secretary

(B) They were the secretary's secretary

(C) Ambiguous

### Formal Fallacies Syllogisms  Negation

Here is a topic for formal fallacies syllogisms  negation:
Given a context involving a set of statements (generated by one of the argument schemes), determine whether an argument---presented informally---can be logically deduced from the provided context.\footnote{This task has a particular focus on negations and was designed to understand whether LLMs can distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.}

For example:

Here comes a perfectly valid argument: Sophie is an infrequent user of Nioxin shampoo. Every owner of a Nexxus shampoo and every infrequent user of Nioxin shampoo is a frequent consumer of Schwarzkopf shampoo. In consequence, Sophie is a frequent consumer of Schwarzkopf shampoo.""

Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?

Options:

\- valid 

\- invalid
