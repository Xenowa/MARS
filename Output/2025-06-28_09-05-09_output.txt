Here is a topic for geometric graph generation:
Given a full SVG path element containing multiple commands, determine the geometric shape that would be generated if one were to execute the full path element.

For example:
This SVG path element <path d=M 64.00,63.00 L 44.00,63.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 64.00,50.00 L 64.00,45.00 L 85.00,57.00 L 64.00,68.00 L 64.00,63.00""/> draws a 
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

I want to input a prompt and this topic into the big language model so that the big language model outputs the highest correctness rate. 
Please generate the most suitable prompt according to the requirements I just mentioned.

Total steps: 5  
Step 1: Review the provided SVG path element to extract the path commands and their meanings.  
Step 2: Translate the path commands into a sequence of points that can be plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system.  
Step 3: Determine the geometric connections between these points to visualize the overall shape created by the path commands.  
Step 4: Analyze the resulting shape to classify it against the given options based on its characteristics.  
Step 5: Formulate the prompt to the language model, ensuring clarity and specificity about the task of identifying the geometric shape derived from the SVG path.
