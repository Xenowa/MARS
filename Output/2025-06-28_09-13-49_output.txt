Here is a topic for geometric graph generation:
Given a full SVG path element containing multiple commands, determine the geometric shape that would be generated if one were to execute the full path element.

For example:
This SVG path element <path d=M 64.00,63.00 L 44.00,63.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 64.00,50.00 L 64.00,45.00 L 85.00,57.00 L 64.00,68.00 L 64.00,63.00""/> draws a 
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

I want to input a prompt and this topic into the big language model so that the big language model outputs the highest correctness rate. 
Please generate the most suitable prompt according to the requirements I just mentioned.

Total steps: 5  
Step 1: Understand the SVG path element syntax and identify the commands (e.g., Move, Line).  
Step 2: Break down the path commands into individual movements and their corresponding coordinates for clarity.  
Step 3: Visualize these movements by plotting them on a coordinate grid to ascertain the resulting shape.  
Step 4: Analyze the visual representation to determine the geometric properties such as the number of sides and angles.  
Step 5: Compare the identified shape against the provided options to determine the most accurate match.

Analyze the provided full SVG path element and determine the geometric shape it represents by breaking down each command step by step. Once you have examined the path commands and visualized their connections, choose the option that best describes the generated shape from the following list: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle.
